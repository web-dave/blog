# My way into tech

I've been asked a lot about how I became a developer.
So I decided to write about my journey.

This is a very personal post, so almost no technical content, just personal experience.

## 1997 -2004

In my last year at school, I had to make a decision. I have had almost a plan for what to do with my life. I want to become a Sound engineer.
Therefore I either needed a high school diploma or completed vocational training.
I felt I was done with school at this time so I decided to start a career as a television technician.
The training company was awesome.
I learned so much and enjoyed the topic.
What I loved the most: Fixing TV and VCR. After my training, I moved to Hamburg to start a job in a small workshop.

## 2004

At this time I realized that most of the televisions in the sHop became Flat TV.
So after two years I quit that job and joined a company that made aircraft electronics. Passenger Control Units and Entertainment Systems for several Companies like Boing, Airbus, Bombadier...

I loved this job, I was able to develop some skills and even hardware.
After a few months, I was promoted as head of the production.
My job was to take care of the PCB production. I also had a team of 8 awesome engineers.

After a few months, I asked my self: How can we get better? Of course, I already was playing around with some production parameters (Movement speed, pressure, temperature) and hoped I could learn how these changes affect the production.

One day during lunchtime I talked to some Software developers and told them my questions. They told me that often, these Machines can write data into Databases and I should check it on my Production machines. I found these Databases and learned how to access them and how to connect the Production Robots to them.
When I arrived home this evening, I started googling about DataBases. I had no clue. I found words like MySQL, MSSQL, so I searched for sources to learn more about it.
On the next day I came up with an (ugly) SQL script to read some specific data and I was able to compare them after I changed some parameters.

So I was deeply impressed by my one-night skills.
But I learned theát Only seeing these numbers wasn't helpful.
And It was kind of weird to open an MYSQP admin to run this script.

Again my Developer friend helped me. He mentioned something called PHP.
It took me two nights to build a PHP script and use a chart library to display some Data.
This was my very first WebApp.
It grows over time and I added more Information. After some weeks, I was wondering, if I can make it more dynamic. At this time, every Report was a reload.
That was the day someone introduced JavaScript to me. This was back in 2004. The Developers around me told me to learn something serious not that toy. I fall in love with JavaScript, so I didn't listen to what turned out to be right
Since then I learned a lot of cool stuff, but most importantly, I learned how to learn and how important a mentor can be.

## 2014

I can't remember how I started AngularJS but I can remember the day when I did my first try with Angular2. It was at around alpha-52.
At this time I already started doing workshops at my employer and I wrote blog posts on how to do web technologies.
I also had a tutorial on AngularJS so to start an Angular2 tutorial was the next logical step.
When I published my post about Angular2 I recognized a new follower on Twitter.
Robin Böhm, Founder of angularjs.de reached out to me to have a chat on some serious topics.
I was scared.
I was expecting some serious argumentation about Angular posts.
But he was very nice and asked me to join the community. He also asked me, if I'm interested to become a Team Member and Trainer at angularjs.de.

This was the beginning of very successful collaboration and we became friends.

## 2016

In 2016 the first Conferences reached out to me to have me as a speaker. I was totally scared because of my English skills. Then I found talk of Manfred Steyer on youtube and his confidence on stage and his pronunciation gave me courage on doing this, later this year, I finally met him in person and thanked him for his silent mentorship.
We started collaborating and we became friends.
At this time some Developers from the Angular Community recognized me and encouraged me to send an application to the Google Developer Expert program.

## 2017

In 2017 I decided to go as a Freelancer. At the same time, my GDE application was proved and I was announced as a GDE in Angular and web technology.

Since then I spoke at many conferences and meetups, did a lot of workshops and met so incredible awesome people from the community.

This Community is very special, ist very family-like.
We take care of each other, like a real family.

I hope you see: There is no "The way" to start your profession. It is important to have mentors and friends. It's important to stay curious. Find your passion, follow it. never give up.

Here a some of the mentioned important (at least to me) people of the community (in no particular order).
They gave me (often by accident) opportunities or help or just a good welcome feeling:
